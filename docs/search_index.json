SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is a scheduler software used to coordinate activities on a grid computing system. Three key functions include: Allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform a task Provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (parallel job) on set of allocated nodes Arbitrates conflicting requests for resources by managing a queue of pending work Command Line Utilities: Command Description sbatch Launch a job with a batch script srun Launch a job without a batch script scancel Terminate a pending or running job squeue Monitor job queues sinfo Monitor partition and overall system state scontrol Get information about a specific job sacct Retrieve information on a running/completed job seff Display resource usage and efficiency of a completed job 2.2 Submitting a Batch Script SLURM header lines and directives: A batch script header must start with a shebang: #!/bin/bash Below are a list of additional header options, which follow this format: #SBATCH [option] Option Description –nodes Request that task and cores are on the same node –ntasks Number of tasks to run (default: 1) –mem Memory requested –job-name Name of the script –qos Quality of service (QoS) –cpus-per-task Number of CPUs requested per task –partition Specifies SLURM partition (example: general) –mail-type Mailing option –mail-user Email notification should be sent to -o myscript_%j.out Standard output will be appended to myscript_%j.out file -e myscript_%j.err Standard error will be appended to myscript_%j.err file 2.3 Loading Software on Xanadu 2.4 Organizing a Project Directory "],["introduction-to-sequencing-data.html", "Module 3 Introduction to Sequencing Data", " Module 3 Introduction to Sequencing Data Learning Objectives: 1) Resources: Overview of Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies, Opportunities and challenges in long-read sequencing data analysis, Linux command line exercises for NGS data processing "],["rna-seq-quality-control.html", "Module 4 RNA-Seq: Quality Control", " Module 4 RNA-Seq: Quality Control Learning Objectives: 1) Resources: "],["rna-seq-read-mapping-igv-and-counts-data.html", "Module 5 RNA-Seq: Read Mapping, IGV, and Counts Data", " Module 5 RNA-Seq: Read Mapping, IGV, and Counts Data Learning Objectives: 1) Resources: "],["introduction-to-rtidyverse.html", "Module 6 Introduction to R/TidyVerse", " Module 6 Introduction to R/TidyVerse Learning Objectives: 1) Resources: "],["rna-seq-statistical-analysis-in-r-deseq2.html", "Module 7 RNA-Seq: Statistical Analysis in R (DESeq2)", " Module 7 RNA-Seq: Statistical Analysis in R (DESeq2) Learning Objectives: 1) Resources: "],["rna-seq-enrichment-and-network-analysis.html", "Module 8 RNA-Seq: Enrichment and Network Analysis", " Module 8 RNA-Seq: Enrichment and Network Analysis Learning Objectives: 1) Resources: "],["rna-seq-visualization.html", "Module 9 RNA-Seq: Visualization", " Module 9 RNA-Seq: Visualization Learning Objectives: 1) Resources: "],["writing-up-results.html", "Module 10 Writing Up Results", " Module 10 Writing Up Results Learning Objectives: 1) Resources: "],["wrap-up-and-synthesis.html", "Module 11 Wrap Up and Synthesis", " Module 11 Wrap Up and Synthesis Learning Objectives: 1) Resources: "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
