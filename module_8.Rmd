## Enrichment Analysis

**Enrichment analysis** identifies biological pathways, functions, and processes that are statistically over-represented in a set of differentially expressed genes.

1.  **Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis:** Assesses enriched biological processes, molecular functions, or cellular components in a list of differentially expressed genes.

    *If a set of genes are upregulated in response to stress, an enrichment analysis may find that terms related to "response to stress" are significantly over-represented.*

2.  **Pathway Enrichment Analysis:** Focuses on identifying pathways (with KEGG) or signaling cascades that are over-represented in a gene list.

    *If a set of genes is involved in cell signaling and responds to extracellular stimuli, the pathway analysis might reveal enrichment in the "MAPK Signaling Pathway."*

## Network Analysis

**Network analysis** unveils intricate relationships between genes, proteins, and other molecular entities, elucidating the complex regulatory mechanisms at play.
