## What is SLURM?
SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is a scheduler software used to coordinate activities on a grid computing system. Three key functions include:


  (1) Allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform a task
  (2) Provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (parallel job) on set of allocated nodes
  (3) Arbitrates conflicting requests for resources by managing a queue of pending work


**Command Line Utilities:**

| Command  | Description                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| sbatch   | Launch a job with a batch script               |
| srun     | Launch a job without a batch script            |
| scancel  | Terminate a pending or running job             |
| squeue   | Monitor job queues                            |
| sinfo    | Monitor partition and overall system state     |
| scontrol | Get information about a specific job           |
| sacct    | Retrieve information on a running/completed job|
| seff     | Display resource usage and efficiency of a completed job |


## Submitting a Batch Script

**SLURM header lines and directives:**

A batch script header **must** start with a shebang: `#!/bin/bash`
Below are a list of additional header options, which follow this format: `#SBATCH [option]`
